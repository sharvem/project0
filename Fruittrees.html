<p>What are Citrus Trees? What is the difference between citrus vs. fruit trees? Citrus trees are fruit trees, but fruit trees are not citrus. That is, the fruit is the seed bearing part of the tree that is usually edible, colorful and fragrant. It is produced from a floral ovary after fertilization. Citrus refers to the shrubs or trees of the family Rutaceae. Citrus Fruit Information Citrus cultivars can be found from northeastern India east through the Malay Archipelago and south into Australia. Both oranges and pummelos were mentioned in ancient Chinese writings dating from 2,400 BC and lemons were written in Sanskrit around 800 BC. Of the different types of citrus, sweet oranges are thought to have arisen in India and trifoliate oranges and mandarins in China. Acid citrus varieties most likely derived in Malaysia.
